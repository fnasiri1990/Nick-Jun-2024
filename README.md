# Nick-Jun-2024
This is the code for tracking Nick's sleeping during Jun 2024
In my recent analysis of Nick's sleep patterns, I've noticed a clear correlation between the number of daytime naps he takes and the frequency of nighttime awakenings. Specifically, on days when he has more naps, he tends to wake up less during the night. Conversely, there are days when he wakes up more frequently, often coinciding with instances where he was unwell, as noted in his journal.

From these observations, it appears that when Nick is sick, the number of daytime naps doesn't significantly affect his nighttime awakenings; he tends to wake up more frequently regardless of his nap schedule. This pattern suggests that illness plays a crucial role in disrupting his sleep patterns.

Given that Nick is going to kindergarten, his tiredness level can impact his ability to fall into deep sleep. When he has fewer naps during the day, he may be too tired to achieve restful sleep at night.

Moving forward into July, I plan to continue monitoring these trends closely. By documenting his nap times, nighttime awakenings, and any instances of illness, I aim to gain further insights into how these factors interact and affect his overall sleep quality. This ongoing analysis will help me better understand and support Nick's sleep needs as he transitions to kindergarten.
